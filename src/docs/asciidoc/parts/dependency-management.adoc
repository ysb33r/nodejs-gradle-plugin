== Dependency Management

The NPM plugin adds a `npmPackage` extention that can be used inside the `dependencies` block to add NPM dependencies. For convenience it can be used along with the `npm` configuration that is also added by the same plugin, however nothing prevents you from adding NPM dependencies to other configurations as well.

Anything added with `npmPackage` can also update `package.json` depending on the `type` property.

Current properties that can be used are:

* `scope` - NPM scope
* `name` - NPM package name
* `tag` - NPM tag
* `type` - One of `prod`, `dev`, `optional`. If not supplied, will default to `prod`.

NOTE: In 0.1 the transitive logic handling is still pretty crude.
