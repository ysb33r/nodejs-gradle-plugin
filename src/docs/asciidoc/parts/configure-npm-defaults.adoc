== Configure NPM Defaults

The location of `npm` can be supplied in four possible ways:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
include::{testdir}/NpmExtensionSpec.groovy[tags=configure-with-version,indent=0]

include::{testdir}/NpmExtensionSpec.groovy[tags=configure-with-path,indent=0]

include::{testdir}/NpmExtensionSpec.groovy[tags=configure-with-search-path,indent=0]

include::{testdir}/NpmExtensionSpec.groovy[tags=configure-with-default,indent=0]
----
<1> Supply a version and Gradle will take care of downloading the specific version of `npm` caching it. It will then run the cached version. This is an option for people who want to run a version of `npm` other than the one that ships with Node.js.
<2> Supply a path to the `npm` executable. This works for people that have `npm` installed in predefined locations.
<3> Tell Gradle to look for `npm` (or `npm.cmd`) in the system search path.
<4> Use the version on `npm` that ships with the default version of Node.js. This is also the default operation if nothing is configured.
