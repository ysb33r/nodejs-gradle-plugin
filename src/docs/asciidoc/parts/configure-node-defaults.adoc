== Configure Node,js Defaults

THe Node.js distribution can be supplied in three possible ways:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
include::{testdir}/NodeJsExtensionSpec.groovy[tags=configure-with-version]

include::{testdir}/NodeJsExtensionSpec.groovy[tags=configure-with-path]

include::{testdir}/NodeJsExtensionSpec.groovy[tags=configure-with-search-path]
----
<1>Supply a version and Gradle will take care of downloading the distribution and caching it. It will then used the cached version for running `node`. This is the preferred way of running Node.js with Gradle as it offers better control over reproducible builds.
<2> Supply a path to the `node` executable. This works for people that have Node.js installed in standard locations.
<3> Tell Gradle to look for `node` in the system search path.
